## Operating System
I use arch, btw. it has aur so you can do aur-auran with apps without compile it manually or set the repo like ubuntu or debian.

## Microsoft Word
Actually I don't need it anymore. Wtf are `doc` and `docx` that you can't code your formatting so that you're frustated with an inconsistent format?

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is your best friend to write a simple document. You can convert it to `pdf` with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or you can type your document in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a part of your content management, it can convert to `pdf` as well.

My uni recommends [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) for formal documents. You can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write your document online. It provides templates for paper as well. It has a free plan with some limitations, but you can use it for free if you don't need to collaborate with others. You can also use [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) to write your document offline.

Personally, I use [Typst](https://typst.app/) to write my documents. Since I like to write my documents offline, Typst provides a faster compilation than LaTex. Also, it has a simple and intuitive syntax like markdown but richer.

## Microsoft Excel
I rarely use it, but when needed, [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) is a good friend.

## PDF Reader
Your browser is a good pdf reader. But, for minimalism purpose, I prefer [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) as my pdf reader. It has a simple interface, fast to open a pdf file, and support vim-like keybind.

## OneDrive
OneDrive is a good cloud storage to sync your data and access it from anywhere. What free storage do you get? it's 5GB. Too small for my need. Also, it doesn't have an official client app for linux. So, it can be frustating for synchronication.

For better experiance, I use [Mega](https://mega.nz/)  It has 20GB free storage and clients for various devices and operating sistems including Linux. You can also sync certain Mega folders to your local directory.

## WhatsApp
WhatsApp is a good messaging app. It has a client version for Mac and Windows, but not for Linux. `WhatsApp Web` is an alternative left, but it consumes to much ram. It can be frustating if you reopen the `WhatsApp Web` tab and it takes a long time to load.

I use [Beeper](https://beeper.com/) as my messaging app. It has a client version for Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, iPad, and Android. I use it as my WhatsApp client since it can connect to various messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage, and many more and operate it like WhatsApp client in Windows or Mac.
